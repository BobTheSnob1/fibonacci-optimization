my attempt on making a fibonacci calculator that is as fast as possible

reaches fib(62012) with python and fib(2229391) with c

suggestions welcome

yes i know it would be faster to just calculate the next fibonacci number rather than all fibonacci numbers up to n every time but i cba to like binary search my way to how many i can do in the time
